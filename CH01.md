# EXERCISES
1. Consider a simple Web browser that takes as input a textual string in
HTML format and displays the specified graphics on the screen. 
Is the display process one of compilation or interpretation?
2. In designing a compiler, you will face many tradeoffs. What are the
five qualities that you, as a user, consider most important in a compiler
that you purchase? Does that list change when you are the compiler
writer? What does your list tell you about a compiler that you would
implement?
3. Compilers are used in many different circumstances. What differences
might you expect in compilers designed for the following applications?
    1. A just-in-time compiler used to translate user interface code downloaded over a network
    2. A compiler that targets the embedded processor used in a cellular telephone
    3. A compiler used in an introductory programming course at a high school
    4. A compiler used to build wind-tunnel simulations that run on a massively parallel processor (where all processors are identical)
    5. A compiler that targets numerically intensive programs to a large number of diverse machines
# SOLUTIONS
1. Interpretation
2. As following, [reference](https://www.coursehero.com/file/p51t6m7/7-Qualities-of-a-Good-Compiler-Correct-the-meaning-of-sentences-must-be/)
    1. Correct: it should always preserve the meaning of the original program design
    2. Robust: it should not crash on wrong input, bug diagnose all kinds of error safely and reliably
    3. Efficient: the process of compilation and interpretation is efficient, and the code it generated is efficient
    4. Usable: it works well with other tools, and generates descriptive error messages
3. As following,
    1. partially compiling, and common interface guess
    2. compiled code size and efficiency
    3. only essential arguments with a GUI, make it easy to understand and use
    4. parallel and fast
    5. optimized for different architectures and math processing
